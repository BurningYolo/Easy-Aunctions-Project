Update with commit 
FYP :) 
WITH EVERY COMMIT INSTEAD OF WRITING IN COMMIT DISCRIPTION JUST WRITE STUFF HERE IN ORDER 


Login 1 2 were the previous version lost cuz of bracnch issues // present in the restored repo 


Login 3 is the master version // code saved ; deleted this code branch thus making v4 the master version 


Login 4 switched to master // switched v4 to v3 and made master 


Added Footer in last commit . 
Login done v4 is main branch . 

(Done before this Push forgot to write here . )Login page done (From this push onwards working on Sign-up then main page) . 

Signup form done added labels as well might have slightly messed up the login page but working on it after this . 
(Work to be done in next  push , Change classes and ids names , add labels and stuff to login form . Add both screen shots as well and remove ss login4 as labels are added thus dosen't match the current version .  )

Signup and Login both done , Images of the UI present in **Current_Design_Images** Folder , The id's and classes name have been changed as well 

Added header and footer to mainpage . 


*Tried replacing vscode ID with github for commits didn't work messed up whole settings never again .....* 


Added a dropdown menu on topbar as hover affect on **Product**  ; is working but will probably need js to make it better (Applied this update on all the pages ) . 


Added dropdown menu for user-image when not logged in display login/signup options on hover . 

Working on Mainpage added slider using keyframes , that will hold images . moving left to right automatically .  current images are just placeholders 

Added a list on side of slide images bar cuz only the bar looked garbo . 

Created 4 div sections on the main page that will show products from database of that specific category , on clicking heading it will redirect to more products page of that specific category (need to make heading of categories a link rather than simple h1 like right now ). 

Main page UI somewhat completed . 

Adding SS of MainPage UI as well in **Current_Design_Images** section .
